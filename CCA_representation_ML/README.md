harnessing representation in exploring compositioanl complex alloys

I am working on a paper that has two aspects about “representations” in exploring compositional complex alloys. The first representation is about projecting alloys in terms of chemistry, structures and properties, onto the combinatorial thin film-type 2-dimensional representation. This much simplifies how we can visualise a gradient alloy structure and properties onto a 2-dimensional representation, and this builds a very strong connection between digitised materials structure and properties with physical experiments. Another representation is about using machine learning, specifically using multi-tasking machine learning to learn the shared representation between different properties.
