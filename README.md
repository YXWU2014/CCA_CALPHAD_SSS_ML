# Harnessing representation in exploring compositional complex alloys

This repository provides a platform for performing calculations and evaluations on quinary alloys A-B-C-D-E using computational thermodynamics and machine learning techniques. It focuses on modelling the phase stability and solid solution strengthening, along with hardness and corrosion pitting potential evaluation.


## Objectives

This repository serves to:

- Perform batch calculations for quinary alloys (A-B-C-D-E) using computational thermodynamics.
  - Model phase stability under full equilibrium and minimum Gibbs energy conditions.
  - Model solid solution strengthening for the targeted alloys.
- Evaluate hardness and corrosion pitting potential using a multitask neural network model (based on the `CCA_representation_ML` submodule).
- Facilitate compositional sampling that takes the representation of combinatorial physical vapor deposition (`SputteringCompoMapNormalised.dat`) and permutations of different mixes of neighbouring elements.

## Visuals

The computational results can be illustrated through visuals such as the plots below, demonstrating the FCC alloy formation tendency under varying thermodynamic evaluations and property evaluations by physical-based models. They also show the solid solution strengthening and the properties computed from the neural network models.

#### phase stability and solid solution strengthening calculation
`v6_A_B_C_D_E_Gmin_FullEquil_SputterCompo_master.m` performs calculations of phase stability under full equilibrium and minimum Gibbs energy, aiming at obtaining FCC alloys.
`v6_A_B_C_D_E_SSS_SputterCompo_master.m` models the solid solution strengthening for the FCC phase under the same sampled compositions.

#### Machine Learning Submodule
`CCA_representation_ML`: This machine learning submodule, maintained in a separate repository, is utilized for evaluating hardness and corrosion pitting potential.

#### Plotting
`sns_plot.ipynb` to generate summary plots
